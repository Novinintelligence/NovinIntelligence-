# Claims Draft (Optional, for Support)

1. A computer-implemented method for on-device, multi-layer threat assessment and explanation comprising: receiving heterogeneous sensor events; validating and rate-limiting inputs; buffering events in a sliding time window; detecting real-world event-chain patterns; analyzing motion via hardware-accelerated vector operations to produce activity types; classifying zones and escalation; extracting features; computing a threat probability via Bayesian fusion of multiple evidence factors; applying temporal dampening and user pattern context; composing an adaptive, human-readable explanation with severity-adaptive tone; and outputting a final threat level and narrative.

2. The method of claim 1 wherein the event-chain patterns comprise at least: package delivery, intrusion sequence, forced entry, active break-in, and prowler activity.

3. The method of claim 1 wherein the motion analysis includes at least one of: L2 norm, energy, and variance via a vector processing framework.

4. The method of claim 1 wherein spatial escalation from perimeter to entry increases threat score by a multiplier and entry to interior establishes a breach.

5. The method of claim 1 wherein evidence factors include temporal, event, and behavioral factors, including pet detection as a dampener and glass-break as a high-weight elevating factor.

6. The method of claim 1 further comprising: health monitoring and graceful degradation among full, degraded, minimal, and emergency modes.

7. A non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions that when executed cause a device to perform the method of any preceding claim.

8. A system comprising at least one processor and memory configured to execute the method of any preceding claim.
