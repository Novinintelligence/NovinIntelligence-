## 🎭 Real Output Examples

### Test 1: Package Delivery
```
📍 INPUT:
  Event Type: doorbell_chime
  Location: front_door
  Home Mode: away
  Duration: 5.0s
  Energy: 0.25

🎯 OUTPUT:
  Threat Level: LOW
  Processing Time: 0.1ms

💬 SUMMARY:
  📦 Likely a package delivery at your front door

🧠 DETAILED REASONING:
  • I detected a doorbell ring followed by brief motion, then silence.
  • This pattern matches 85% with typical package deliveries.
  • The quick in-and-out behavior suggests someone dropped something off.

📊 CONTEXT:
  • Event sequence: package_delivery
  • Motion type: package_drop
  • Duration: 5s
  • Location: front_door (entry)
  • Time: Delivery window (14:00)

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
  📦 Likely a delivery. Check for packages when you return home.

✅ PASS
```

### Test 2: Night Prowler
```
📍 INPUT:
  Event Type: motion
  Location: backyard
  Home Mode: away
  Duration: 45.0s
  Energy: 0.60

🎯 OUTPUT:
  Threat Level: ELEVATED
  Processing Time: 0.1ms

💬 SUMMARY:
  👁️ Unusual activity pattern detected at backyard

🧠 DETAILED REASONING:
  • Activity continued for over 30 seconds with sustained energy.
  • Your backyard could indicate someone approaching entry points.
  • Night activity while away raises the threat level.

📊 CONTEXT:
  • Motion type: loitering
  • Duration: 45s
  • Location: backyard (perimeter)
  • Time: Night (2:00)

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
  ⚠️ Check your cameras to identify who it is.

✅ PASS
```

### Test 3: Glass Break Emergency
```
📍 INPUT:
  Event Type: glass_break
  Location: living_room
  Home Mode: away
  Duration: 2.0s
  Energy: 0.90

🎯 OUTPUT:
  Threat Level: CRITICAL
  Processing Time: 0.1ms

💬 SUMMARY:
  🚨 ALERT: Glass breaking detected at living room

🧠 DETAILED REASONING:
  • Glass breaking is a critical security event requiring immediate attention.
  • High confidence detection (95%) suggests real break, not false alarm.
  • Motion inside your home while away is highly unusual.

📊 CONTEXT:
  • Event type: glass_break
  • Confidence: 95%
  • Location: living_room (interior)
  • Time: Night (3:00)

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
  🚨 Check camera immediately and consider calling authorities.

✅ PASS
```

### Test 4: Pet Movement (Reassuring)
```
📍 INPUT:
  Event Type: pet
  Location: hallway
  Home Mode: home
  Duration: 8.0s
  Energy: 0.30

🎯 OUTPUT:
  Threat Level: LOW
  Processing Time: 0.2ms

💬 SUMMARY:
  🐾 Pet movement detected at hallway

🧠 DETAILED REASONING:
  • Erratic, low-intensity movement matches pet behavior (82% confidence).
  • Interior motion while you're home is expected normal activity.

📊 CONTEXT:
  • Motion type: pet
  • Duration: 8s
  • Location: hallway (transition)
  • Time: 15:00

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
  ✓ This appears normal. No action needed.

✅ PASS
```

### Test 5: Forced Entry Attempt
```
📍 INPUT:
  Event Type: door
  Location: back_door
  Home Mode: away
  Duration: 12.0s
  Energy: 0.80

🎯 OUTPUT:
  Threat Level: CRITICAL
  Processing Time: 0.2ms

💬 SUMMARY:
  🚨 Possible forced entry attempt at back door

🧠 DETAILED REASONING:
  • Multiple door events in short time (4 events in 12s).
  • Rapid repetition indicates forced entry attempt, not normal access.
  • Activity didn't stop - someone may be breaching security.

📊 CONTEXT:
  • Event sequence: forced_entry
  • Events: 4 door attempts in 12s
  • Location: back_door (entry)
  • Time: Night (22:00)

💡 RECOMMENDATION:
  ⚠️ Verify your security - check if doors/windows are secure.

✅ PASS
```
