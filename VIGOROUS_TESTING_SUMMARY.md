**Metrics Tracked:**
- Test files count
- Test methods count
- SDK files count
- Tests per SDK file ratio

### 5. Regression Testing

**Prevent Breaking Changes:**
```bash
./regression_test_suite.sh
```

**Validates:**
- ✅ 12 critical test scenarios
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (response times)
- ✅ API compatibility (method signatures)
- ✅ Backward compatibility (legacy formats)

**Creates Baseline:**
- First run creates `baseline.json`
- Subsequent runs compare against baseline
- Auto-updates baseline on success
- Alerts on any regressions
