    ("Package Delivery", """
📦 Likely a package delivery at your front door

REASONING:
I detected a doorbell ring followed by brief motion, then silence. This pattern matches 85% with typical package deliveries. The quick in-and-out behavior suggests someone dropped something off rather than lingering. It's during typical delivery hours (9AM-6PM), which makes delivery activity more likely. Your home is in away mode, which means any activity gets elevated attention.

CONTEXT:
- Event sequence: package delivery
- Motion type: package drop
- Duration: 5s
- Location: front door (entry)
- Time: Delivery window (14:00)

RECOMMENDATION:
📦 Likely a delivery. Check for packages when you return home.
"""),
    
    ("Night Prowler", """
👁️ Someone moving around your property perimeter

REASONING:
I tracked movement across multiple zones of your property within a minute. This perimeter reconnaissance pattern suggests someone scoping out your home. Activity at the backyard could indicate someone approaching your entry points. Night activity while you're away raises the threat level - most legitimate visitors come during the day. Your home is in away mode, which means any activity gets elevated attention.

CONTEXT:
- Event sequence: prowler activity
- Location: backyard (perimeter)
- Time: Night (2:00)
- Delivery patterns: Frequent

RECOMMENDATION:
🔍 Someone is moving around your property. Check your cameras to identify who it is.
"""),

    ("Active Break-In", """
🚨 ALERT: Active break-in detected at living room window

REASONING:
Glass breaking followed immediately by motion is a classic break-in signature. The timing and sequence strongly suggest forced entry in progress. Motion inside your home while you're away is highly unusual and concerning.

CONTEXT:
- Event sequence: active break in
- Motion type: running
- Duration: 3s  
- Location: living room window (interior)
- Time: Night (3:00)

RECOMMENDATION:
🚨 Check your camera immediately and consider calling authorities. This appears to be an active security incident.
"""),

    ("Pet Activity", """
🐾 Pet movement detected at hallway

REASONING:
The erratic, low-intensity movement pattern matches pet behavior (82% confidence). Interior motion while you're home is expected normal activity.

CONTEXT:
- Motion type: pet
- Duration: 8s
- Location: hallway (transition)
- Time: 15:00

RECOMMENDATION:
✓ This appears normal. No action needed, but feel free to review footage if curious.
"""),

    ("Daytime Delivery (Home)", """
📦 Your delivery has probably arrived - check your front door.

REASONING:
The motion lasted only 4 seconds with low energy - typical of someone quickly placing a package. It's during typical delivery hours (9AM-6PM), which makes delivery activity more likely. You receive deliveries frequently, so I've learned to recognize delivery patterns at your home.

CONTEXT:
- Motion type: package drop
- Duration: 4s
- Location: front door (entry)
- Time: Delivery window (11:00)
- Delivery patterns: Frequent

RECOMMENDATION:
📦 Your delivery has probably arrived - check your front door.
"""),

    ("Loitering at Night", """
👤 Someone lingering near back door

REASONING:
Activity continued for over 30 seconds with sustained but moderate energy - someone appears to be waiting or watching. Your back door is a primary access point - any activity here gets elevated scrutiny. It's nighttime, so I'm being more vigilant, but this could still be routine activity.

CONTEXT:
- Motion type: loitering
- Duration: 35s
- Location: back door (entry)
- Time: Night (22:00)

RECOMMENDATION:
ℹ️ Check your cameras when convenient - this activity is worth reviewing.

🧠 PERSONALIZED REASONING:
  ✓ Explains WHY decision was made, not just confidence score
  ✓ References learned patterns ("you receive deliveries frequently")
  ✓ Considers user's situation (home vs away)
  ✓ Natural language, not technical jargon

📊 CONTEXTUAL FACTORS:
  ✓ Shows all inputs considered
  ✓ Event sequences, motion types, zones, time
  ✓ Transparent decision-making

💡 ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ✓ Tells user what to DO, not just what happened
