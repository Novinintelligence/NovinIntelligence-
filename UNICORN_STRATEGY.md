# Unicorn Strategy (NovinIntelligence)

Date: October 2, 2025  
Scope: Path to category leadership and unicorn valuation in 12 months

---

## North-Star Outcome
- Build and own the category: Explainable, On-Device Security AI for smart home brands.
- Win 3+ top OEMs (Ring, Nest, ADT/Eufy) and become the de facto standard.

## 3 Pillars of Unicorn Probability
- 1) 10x Product: 60–70% false-positive reduction, <50ms p95 latency, human-grade explanations.
- 2) Defensible Moat: patents + data flywheel + on-device edge + partner certification.
- 3) Distribution Advantage: lighthouse pilots → co-brand program → OEM scale.

## Quantified KPIs (prove inevitability)
- False positives: -60% to -70% vs control (A/B).
- Latency: p95 < 50ms on-device; p99 < 80ms.
- Actionable alert rate (opens→action): >35%.
- 30/90-day retention of notifications on: >85% / >75%.
- NPS > 60 on AI explanations.
- OEM attach rate > 40% on new devices in pilot lines.
- Gross margin > 85% (low COGS, on-device processing).

## 12-Month Roadmap (Quarterly)
- Q1 (0–3 mo): Proof & Moat
  - Sign 2–3 lighthouse pilots (paid SOW). Build A/B harness + reference app.
  - File provisional patents: Explanation Engine, Event Chain Analyzer, Motion Classification (vDSP).
  - SOC 2 Type I kickoff; DPIA/GDPR privacy posture docs.
  - Publish open benchmark + challenge (non-PII) showing 60–70% reduction.
- Q2 (4–6 mo): Convert & Package
  - Convert 1–2 pilots to commercial agreements.
  - Launch “Powered by NovinIntelligence” certification & brand guidelines.
  - Ship Platform v1: telemetry API, partner dashboards, SDK hardening; Android/NDK port.
  - Pricing experiments: OEM per-device + premium feature uplift + rev share.
- Q3 (7–9 mo): Scale & Partner
  - Insurer partnerships (discounts for verified AI explanations).
  - SI/channel partners; reference architectures for Ring/Nest/ADT ecosystems.
  - Federated analytics (privacy-safe) for aggregate improvements.
- Q4 (10–12 mo): Category Ownership
  - Public case studies with quantified ROI; independent TPRM/compliance.
  - Developer ecosystem (samples, sandboxes, tutorials) and annual AI report.
  - SOC 2 Type II complete; 3+ top OEMs in production.

## Moat & IP
- Patents: explanation templates with prioritized chains, sliding window sequence detection, Bayesian fusion with tone adaptation, vDSP motion classification features.
- Data flywheel: privacy-safe telemetry (aggregate factors, not PII); partner certification program.
- On-device edge: low latency, privacy-first compliance advantage (GDPR/CCPA), no cloud costs.

## Pricing & Unit Economics
- OEM license + per-device ($0.50–$2.00) + premium features (explainability UX, analytics) $0.50–$1.00.
- Optional rev-share on premium subscriptions driven by higher engagement.
- Target >85% GM; zero cloud inference costs.

## GTM Motions
- Lighthouse pilots with hard SLAs + A/B designs (success = -60% false positives + >35% action rate).
- Co-brand program to create consumer pull (“Explainable AI inside”).
- ROI calculators + demo scripts highlighting delivery vs prowler, glass break overrides, adaptive tone.

## Risks & Mitigations
- OEM dependency → diversify across 3+ brands; portable SDK (iOS/macOS/Android/embedded).
- Copycat risk → patents + certification + telemetry-driven quality; public benchmarks.
- Platform fragility → invest in QA, long-run soak tests, SOC2, SBOM, supply-chain security.

## Fundraising Narrative (Data-Driven)
- Traction: pilots signed; A/B deltas; attach rate; OEM LOIs; NPS>60; p95 latency evidence.
- TAM: Smart home devices + monitoring services; margin expansion via on-device AI.
- Defensibility: IP + on-device + data flywheel + brand certification.

## Next 72 Hours (Execution)
- Send pilot SOW + A/B plan templates; book technical workshops.
- File provisional patents (3 filings) with counsel.
- Stand up partner dashboard spec (telemetry, KPIs) and draft co-brand guidelines.
- Prepare 6-min demo: delivery vs prowler; glass break critical; learning adaptation.
