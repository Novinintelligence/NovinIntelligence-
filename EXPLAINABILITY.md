# AI Explainability Engine - Human-like Reasoning

**Feature**: Personalized, adaptive explanations for every security event  
**NO Hardcoded Outcomes**: Every explanation is unique and contextual  
**Better Than Ring/Nest**: Explains the "why", not just confidence scores

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

### Ring/Nest Approach:
```
"Motion detected at front door"
"Person detected - Confidence: 85%"
"Alert: Activity detected"
```
❌ Generic, robotic, same every time  
❌ No context, no reasoning  
❌ Just data, no insight

### NovinIntelligence Approach:
```
"📦 Likely a package delivery at your front door"

REASONING:
I detected a doorbell ring followed by brief motion, then silence.  
This pattern matches 85% with typical package deliveries. The quick  
in-and-out behavior suggests someone dropped something off rather  
than lingering. It's during typical delivery hours (9AM-6PM), which  
makes delivery activity more likely.

RECOMMENDATION:
📦 Likely a delivery. Check for packages when you return home.
```
✅ Human-like, personal, adaptive  
✅ Explains "why" with context  
✅ Actionable recommendation

## 🧠 How It Works

### 4-Part Explanation Structure:

1. **Adaptive Summary** (What happened)
   - Context-aware (time, location, pattern)
   - Emoji indicators for quick scanning
   - Never generic ("motion detected" → "📦 package delivery")

2. **Detailed Reasoning** (Why we think this)
   - Chain pattern analysis
   - Motion behavior analysis
   - Zone-based context
   - Time context
   - User pattern learning
   - Home mode consideration

3. **Contextual Factors** (What was considered)
   - Event sequences
   - Motion types
   - Location & zone
   - Time of day
   - User patterns

4. **Personalized Recommendation** (What to do)
   - Urgency-appropriate
   - Specific actions
   - Considers user's situation

## 🎨 Tone Adaptation

The AI automatically adjusts communication tone:

### 🚨 URGENT (Active Threats)
```
"🚨 ALERT: Active break-in detected at living room window"

REASONING:
Glass breaking followed immediately by motion is a classic  
break-in signature. The timing and sequence strongly suggest  
forced entry in progress.

RECOMMENDATION:
🚨 Check your camera immediately and consider calling authorities.  
This appears to be an active security incident.
```

### ⚠️ ALERTING (Elevated Concerns)
```
"👁️ Someone moving around your property perimeter"

REASONING:
I tracked movement across multiple zones within a minute.  
This perimeter reconnaissance pattern suggests someone  
scoping out your home.

RECOMMENDATION:
🔍 Check your cameras to identify who it is.
```

### ℹ️ INFORMATIVE (Standard Monitoring)
```
"ℹ️ Daytime activity detected at front door"

REASONING:
It's during typical delivery hours, and the motion pattern  
is consistent with normal visitor activity.

RECOMMENDATION:
ℹ️ Review camera footage if you want more details.
```

### ✓ REASSURING (Normal Activity)
```
"🐾 Pet movement detected at hallway"

REASONING:
The erratic, low-intensity movement matches pet behavior  
(82% confidence). Interior motion while you're home is  
expected normal activity.

RECOMMENDATION:
✓ This appears normal. No action needed.
```

## 📊 Real Examples

### Example 1: Package Delivery (Away Mode)
```json
{
  "summary": "📦 Likely a package delivery at your front door",
  "detailed_reasoning": "I detected a doorbell ring followed by brief motion, then silence. This pattern matches 85% with typical package deliveries. The quick in-and-out behavior suggests someone dropped something off rather than lingering. It's during typical delivery hours (9AM-6PM), which makes delivery activity more likely. Your home is in away mode, which means any activity gets elevated attention.",
  "context": [
    "Event sequence: package delivery",
    "Motion type: package drop",
    "Duration: 5s",
    "Location: front door (entry)",
    "Time: Delivery window (14:00)"
  ],
  "recommendation": "📦 Likely a delivery. Check for packages when you return home."
}
```

### Example 2: Night Prowler
```json
{
  "summary": "👁️ Someone moving around your property perimeter",
  "detailed_reasoning": "I tracked movement across multiple zones of your property within a minute. This perimeter reconnaissance pattern suggests someone scoping out your home. Activity at the backyard could indicate someone approaching your entry points. Night activity while you're away raises the threat level - most legitimate visitors come during the day.",
  "context": [
    "Event sequence: prowler activity",
    "Location: backyard (perimeter)",
    "Time: Night (2:00)"
  ],
  "recommendation": "🔍 Someone is moving around your property. Check your cameras to identify who it is."
}
```

### Example 3: Pet Activity (Home Mode)
```json
{
  "summary": "🐾 Pet movement detected at hallway",
  "detailed_reasoning": "The erratic, low-intensity movement pattern matches pet behavior (82% confidence). Interior motion while you're home is expected normal activity.",
  "context": [
    "Motion type: pet",
    "Duration: 8s",
    "Location: hallway (transition)",
    "Time: 15:00"
  ],
  "recommendation": "✓ This appears normal. No action needed, but feel free to review footage if curious."
}
```

## 🔧 API Integration

### Accessing Explanations

```swift
import NovinIntelligence

let json = """
{
    "type": "motion",
    "timestamp": \(Date().timeIntervalSince1970),
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "metadata": {
        "location": "front_door",
        "home_mode": "away"
    }
}
"""

let assessment = try await NovinIntelligence.shared.assess(requestJson: json)

// Access human-readable fields
print(assessment.summary)              // "📦 Likely a package delivery..."
print(assessment.detailedReasoning)    // Full explanation
print(assessment.context)              // ["Event sequence: ...", ...]
print(assessment.recommendation)       // "📦 Likely a delivery..."

// Also in PI-format JSON
let piJson = try assessment.toPI()
// Includes all explanation fields in meta
```

### PI-Format Output
```json
{
  "event_type": "security_assessment",
  "threat": {
    "level": "low",
    "confidence_pct": 75
  },
  "processing": {
    "time_ms": 18
  },
  "meta": {
    "reasoning": "Assessment: LOW | Chain: package_delivery...",
    "summary": "📦 Likely a package delivery at your front door",
    "detailed_reasoning": "I detected a doorbell ring followed by...",
    "context": ["Event sequence: package delivery", "Motion type: package drop"],
    "recommendation": "📦 Likely a delivery. Check for packages when you return home."
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

| Feature | Ring/Nest | NovinIntelligence |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Summary** | "Motion detected" | "📦 Package delivery at front door" |
| **Reasoning** | None | "I detected doorbell → motion → silence..." |
| **Context** | Timestamp only | Time, location, patterns, user history |
| **Recommendation** | Generic alert | "Check for packages when you return" |
| **Personalization** | None | Learns user patterns ("you receive frequent deliveries") |
| **Tone** | Always urgent | Adapts (urgent/alerting/informative/reassuring) |
| **Adaptability** | Same every time | Unique for each situation |

---

## 🧬 Personalization Examples

### Learning from User Patterns:

**High Delivery Frequency User:**
```
"The motion lasted only 4 seconds with low energy - typical of  
someone quickly placing a package. You receive deliveries frequently,  
so I've learned to recognize delivery patterns at your home."
```

**False Positive History:**
```
"You've marked similar doorbell_motion events as false alarms before,  
so I'm being less aggressive."
```

### Context-Aware Phrasing:

**Away Mode:**
```
"Your home is in away mode, which means any activity gets  
elevated attention."
```

**Home Mode:**
```
"You're home, so I expect some normal activity - I'm filtering  
out routine movements."
```

**Night Time:**
```
"Night activity while you're away raises the threat level -  
most legitimate visitors come during the day."
```

**Delivery Window:**
```
"It's during typical delivery hours (9AM-6PM), which makes  
delivery activity more likely."
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Mobile App Integration:

```swift
// Notification with smart summary
let notification = UNMutableNotificationContent()
notification.title = assessment.summary  // "📦 Package delivery"
notification.body = assessment.detailedReasoning.prefix(100) + "..."
notification.userInfo = [
    "recommendation": assessment.recommendation,
    "context": assessment.context
]

// Rich notification with action buttons
if assessment.threatLevel == .critical {
    notification.categoryIdentifier = "URGENT_THREAT"
    // Shows "Call 911" and "View Camera" buttons
} else if assessment.recommendation?.contains("Check") == true {
    notification.categoryIdentifier = "REVIEW_FOOTAGE"
    // Shows "View Camera" button
}
```
