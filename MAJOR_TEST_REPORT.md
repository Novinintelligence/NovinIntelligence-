✅ **Pattern Recognition**
- Detects sequences (doorbell → motion → silence) not just individual events
- Recognizes delivery, intrusion, forced entry, and prowler patterns

✅ **Temporal Awareness**
- Adjusts threat levels based on time of day
- Understands delivery windows and typical activity patterns

✅ **Probabilistic Reasoning**
- Combines multiple evidence sources using Bayesian mathematics
- Weighs confidence, context, and patterns

✅ **Adaptive Learning**
- Learns user-specific patterns (frequent deliveries, pet behavior)
- Reduces false positives over time

✅ **Human-Like Explanation**
- Generates natural language reasoning, not just confidence scores
- Adapts tone from urgent (🚨) to reassuring (✓)
